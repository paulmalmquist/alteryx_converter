# MAGIC # Alteryx Workflow Conversion Placeholder
# MAGIC The provided instructions reference a `.yxmd` Alteryx workflow, but the XML content was not included in the repository or the task payload (the placeholder `{{PASTE_YXMD_XML_HERE}}` remained empty).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To complete the conversion, paste the full `.yxmd` XML into the `yxmd_xml` variable below and extend the transformation sections accordingly.

# COMMAND ----------
from textwrap import dedent

# Placeholder variable expected to contain the Alteryx workflow XML.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## TODO: Parse the Alteryx workflow XML
# MAGIC Implement XML parsing logic once the workflow definition is available.

# COMMAND ----------
# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## TODO: Recreate Alteryx tools as PySpark transformations
# MAGIC Add one section per tool (inputs, joins, filters, formulas, etc.) once the XML is available.

# COMMAND ----------
# Placeholder for the final DataFrame resulting from the workflow recreation.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC Implement the write logic after df_final has been constructed.
